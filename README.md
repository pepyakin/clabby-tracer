# tracer

A trace viewer for distributed systems where many nodes run the *same* system.
It reads spans and events from a [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/)
instance and renders them as multi-instance flamegraphs: spans emitted by
separate nodes executing the same protocol viewed side by side.

## Why tracer

### For multi-instance deployments

Distributed systems emit one logical operation (a consensus round, a quorum, a
broadcast) across many nodes at once. Most viewers show you one node's spans at
a time. tracer is built around the cross-node view:

- **One lane per node.** Each node emits its own trace; **Compare** correlates
  the same span across them by name + attribute (e.g. `round`, `height=42`)
  and lays each node out on its own lane on a shared time axis — so
  you see who started late, who stalled, and how the work overlapped across the
  cluster.
- **Trace IDs stay real.** Each node emits its operations as ordinary,
  independent traces with standard OpenTelemetry trace IDs; cross-node
  correlation is by span name + attributes, never a shared trace ID.
- **Merged aggregate flame.** Collapse all instances onto one flame, each span
  split into per-instance sub-bars, to compare the same code path across nodes.
- **Cross-node skew, surfaced.** A **stats** tab (per span: p50/p95/max, error
  rate, and the straggler node + its delta) and a **heatmap** (span × node, hot
  cells = the slow node per phase) make the lagging node obvious at a glance.
- **Focus a sub-tree across services.** Double-click a span to zoom every
  node's matching sub-tree at once — drill into "exchange" on all 20 nodes
  together, not one trace at a time.
- **Sort lanes** by duration / finish time / error count to float stragglers to
  the top.

### vs. Grafana's default Tempo viewer

Grafana renders a single trace as one span tree. tracer is a focused,
purpose-built viewer that goes further:

- **Multi-instance is the model, not an afterthought** — per-node lanes, the
  merged flame, and the cross-node stats/heatmap above have no equivalent in
  Grafana's single-tree view.
- **A real flamegraph canvas** — wheel-zoom around the cursor, drag-pan, a
  scrubbable timeline minimap, **self-time** shading, and live
  **span search/highlight** — fast for ~10k spans.
- **Events are first-class** — an events overlay on the flame plus a dedicated
  searchable events tab.
- **Zero setup to read.** No datasource config, no login: the deployment is
  pinned to one Tempo via `TEMPO_URL`, the browser only talks to the viewer's
  origin (no CORS), and it opens straight on results.
- **Dense, quiet, monospace UI** designed for reading traces, not dashboards.
- **An agent-first REST API.** The same parsing/dedup/aggregation that powers
  the UI is served as a typed, self-describing API under `/api/v1` — built
  for AI agents (and scripts) exploring trace data.

## Quick start

Run the published image, pointed at your Tempo. One process serves the UI,
the REST API (`/api/v1`), and a read-only `/tempo/*` passthrough, so browsers
and agents only talk to the viewer's origin (no CORS needed on Tempo):

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e TEMPO_URL=https://tempo.example.com \
  ghcr.io/clabby/tracer-web:latest
```

Then open http://localhost:8080. `TEMPO_URL` is required and accepts a
`host:port` (assumed http, e.g. `tempo:3200`) or a full URL; to reach a Tempo
running on the host, use `-e TEMPO_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3200`. See
[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md) for deployment details.

## Demo

No Tempo handy? Run the bundled demo — single-binary Tempo, a simulated
multi-node consensus cluster, and the viewer:

```sh
cd docker && just demo
open http://localhost:8080
```

`just demo` builds the images and starts the stack; the nodes emit one
consensus round per second. Stop it with `just demo-down`. See
[`docker/demo/README.md`](docker/demo/README.md).

## The REST API (for agents)

Every deployment serves a typed REST API under `/api/v1` — the middle layer
between Tempo and clients. It does what the UI's engine does (deterministic
newest-first search, OTLP parsing, span dedup, and cross-node correlation of one
span by name + attribute) and returns compact, schema-stable JSON:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1                  # discovery index: every route + examples
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/openapi.json     # OpenAPI 3.1, schemas incl. units
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs             # agent guide (also /.well-known/llms.txt)

curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/search/traces?errorsOnly=true&since=1h&limit=10'
curl -s  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/traces/$TRACE_ID/summary     # one node's rollup, no spans

# correlate one span across nodes that each emit their OWN trace (name + attribute):
curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/compare?name=round&nameRegex=false&attr=span.height%3D42&since=1h'
curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/compare/aggregate?name=round&nameRegex=false&attr=span.height%3D42&since=1h'  # per-node stats per code path
```

The API is self-describing (start at `GET /api/v1`); all errors are RFC 9457
`problem+json` with per-field hints. Statistical insights (stats tab,
heatmap) stay client-side by design.

### Install the agent skill

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that teaches an agent
the API's conventions and recipes ships in [`skills/tracer-api`](skills/tracer-api/SKILL.md).
Install it by copying it into your project's (or global) skills directory:

```sh
# project-local (recommended): available to anyone working in that repo
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -r path/to/tracer/skills/tracer-api .claude/skills/

# or globally, for every project on this machine
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r path/to/tracer/skills/tracer-api ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then ask things like *"which node was slowest in the last few rounds on
http://localhost:8080?"* — the agent will discover the rest from `/api/v1`.

## Development

```sh
cd web
bun install
bun run dev:api    # API server on :7777 (TEMPO_URL defaults to localhost:3200)
bun run dev        # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api → :7777, /tempo → :3200
bun test src server # unit tests
bun run check      # typecheck (also the API schema drift gate)
```

The Rust load generator lives in `docker/demo/loadgen/`
(`cargo run -p consensus-sim` from there), the deployment pieces in `docker/`.
Architecture and contracts: `AGENTS.md`.
